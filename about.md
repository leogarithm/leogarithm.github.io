My name is LÃ©o Giroud, I am studying physics in Grenoble, France. Quantum mechanics and quantum information are the subjects I like the most!
This is my personnal webpage where I share with the world my -mostly interesting- stuff, related to maths, physics, or programmation most of the time.
You can find me on other platforms, such as Linkedin or Instagram (I like to take pretty pictures).
